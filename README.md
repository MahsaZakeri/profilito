## ✨ Why Profilito?

After years of dedicating my craft to building products for others, I’ve finally taken the time to build something for myself - a digital space to reflect who I am, what I’ve done, and where I’m headed.

**Profilito** is the start of that journey. It’s a living, evolving project that will continue to grow with me, professionally and personally.
