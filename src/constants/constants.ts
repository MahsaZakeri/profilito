        Currently part of a cross-functional frontend team at a fast-paced Australian company with 50–200 team members, including 17+ nationalities. I work remotely from Iran, bridging a 6.5-hour time difference by starting early (6 a.m. local time) to collaborate in real-time with my team. We operate in 2-week sprint cycles, with structured stand-ups, reviews, and retros — emphasizing continuous improvement and clear communication.
    
        I contribute to both web and mobile platforms across Angular and Flutter codebases, working side-by-side with 2 QAs, 2 designers, and 2 backend engineers. Our team, known as “Titans”, takes pride in quality, performance, and cohesion. I’ve been actively involved in a large-scale frontend revamp since day one, helping modernize architecture, boost performance, and improve user experience across all interfaces.
    
        My work spans collaborating closely with designers through Figma, integrating APIs with Postman and Swagger, managing sprint tasks via ClickUp, and pushing clean, scalable code through GitHub and Azure DevOps. I contribute to our Angular upgrade efforts, actively participate in code reviews, and support automated testing practices to ensure reliability. Whether tackling UI bugs or planning features, I stay involved from discovery to delivery with a strong sense of ownership and care.

      description: `
        During an early-stage startup journey that quickly collided with the global pandemic, I joined ProShot as a Front-End Developer. Just a couple months in, our team lead departed unexpectedly, and I stepped up—initially to support team morale, and soon after, to officially lead our small but passionate frontend group. As one of the few women in the room, I embraced the responsibility of not only coding, but uniting the team’s energy and spirit through uncertainty.
  
        Working in a hybrid setup, our agile company (with under 50 employees) housed a cross-functional tech team that included two backend engineers, two designers, a six-person mobile team, myself, and three other frontend developers. Together, we designed and built a real-time social communication platform using React, Socket.IO, WebRTC, and Material UI. I also contributed to a landing page project using Next.js. We followed a monthly sprint cycle, held sprint reviews, and emphasized regular code reviews and team retrospectives.
  
        I played a key role in onboarding new developers as the team grew, creating documentation and processes that have helped keep our growing codebase maintainable and easy to understand. Many of the components I architected were reusable by design, significantly reducing development time and boosting efficiency. Beyond development, I actively collaborated with designers via Figma, coordinated API testing using Postman and Swagger, planned and tracked progress in Jira, and contributed code through our private GitLab environment.

        I began my career at Shaya Smart Solutions — a SaaS company delivering end-to-end digital platforms to clients without in-house technical teams. It was an exciting environment, constantly evolving with multiple concurrent projects spanning AI, data platforms, and marketing analytics tools.
  
        I joined as an intern while starting university, initially contributing to an AI-based voice recognition project. My work included collecting and cleaning training data, building internal dashboards, and supporting backend collaboration for model training. This early exposure gave me hands-on experience in real-world product development.
  
        As I grew into a junior React developer, I played a key role in migrating legacy Angular codebases into modern, maintainable React applications. This process sharpened my skills in architecture, reusable components, and code clarity, while also sparking my interest in Angular. Shaya was home to a mid-sized, cross-functional team (about 50 people), where I worked closely with 2 front-end developers, 2 backend engineers, and a designer in an Agile environment.
